## **New Rules of RZ**
- While you are in your safe zone, enemies can't attack your town
- You will be given 1 relocation item before battle starts, use it to relocate near assigned building after preparation time completes and before sending out any formation.
- Rallies will now take less time to complete. Before it was 5 minutes now it will complete in 1,2,3 minutes (We still don't know exact timings)

## **Teams and Groups**
- First person against every building has the responsibility to send their free formation to building and destroy first walker so that there is no time wasted killing it and sending back the formation again. e.g. for Ammo Depot King Luffi will send his F2 to Ammo depot to kill level 19 walker and send F1 after 4-5 seconds so that it can directly garrison the building. 
- Every building will have 2 walkers. Killing first walker will send your formation back but killing second walker will allow your formation to garrison immediatly. e.g. Hospital has level 19 and level 13 (2 walkers). if you kill level 19 with your F2 it will be sent back then if you send F1 to kill level 13 it will garrison the building after killing walker.

## **Buildings and Buffs**

1.  ### **Command Center (Corner big building):**

    1.  An occupied Command Center 142Rvides Victory Points (Solo and Clan) for the occupying Clan. It also allows members of the occupying Clan to relocate near the Command Center. If the Command Center is taken, you will automatically relocate to your Clanâ€™s Safe Zone.

2.  ### **Arsenal (Center Building) :**

    1.  An occupied Arsenal 142Rvides Victory Points (Solo and Clan), plus a bonus amount of Victory Points every 10 minutes (Clan).

3.  ### **Supply point (Material in Map):**

    1.  Members of your Clan can send Formations to Supply Points to gather Victory Points (solo and for our Clan).

4.  ### **Guard Tower (Sentry Tower in Map):**

    1.  An occupied Guard Tower 142Rvides Victory Points (Solo and Clan) for the occupying Clan. It also increases damage dealt to the enemy in the Arsenal. This damage buff stacks.

5.  ### **Workshop :**

    1.  An occupied Workshop 142Rvides Battlefield Relocation items for members of the occupying Clan (only for use on the battlefield).

6.  ### **Ammo depot (Armory in Map) :**

    1.  An occupied Ammo Depot greatly increases the attack and defence of the members of the occupying Clan.

7.  ### **Gas station :**

    1.  An occupied Gas Station 142Rvides Adrenaline to members of the occupying Clan, needed to allow Formations to march over the battlefield.

8.  ### **Hospital :**

    1.  An occupied Hospital greatly increases the healing speed for members of the occupying Clan.

##  **Starting Rules:**

1.  Heal all your troops before joining the battle. Hospitals will have +500% capacity as I have seen. It means if your hospital can have 10,000 troops in main game, there will be space for 50,000 troops in restricted zone. 
2.  Constantly heal your troops after starting the battle, if your hospitals are full they are going to die in the main game too
3.  We need either 50 million (50,000,000) points or more points than other clan at the time end for winning the game
4.  Relocate near your assigned building before sending out any formations.

## Other things to note:
- every building will have some time before it can be occupied, just like communities (around 2-3 minutes) make sure we garrison the building after attacking.
- heal all your troops before entering the battle, hospitals must be empty.
- send your F4 to gather in the supply zone after killing walkers with it. save 20-30 percent adrenaline if there is an emergency.
- save your relocation cards you can only get more once you occupy the workshop.
- always click the help button, heal troops in 10 minutes batches. for example, putting 30 T7 troops for healing takes 10 minutes. I am suggesting this because we have players who can click the help button so those 10 minutes will be instantly finished.
- if you don't have any RSS, get some from inventory. we need at least something for healing the troops and you are not getting any RSS on the battlefield.

## Warnings:
- Talk only about important things in the main chat. No Hi hello or jokes, if you chat without any kind of importance and other members cannot read important messages because of you, you will be kicked from the whole event.
- Don't leave the event and get into the main game. if you do that you can not join the event again, substitute players will take your place.
- all substitutes will be placed according to the absence of selected players in their respective teams.
- never leave clan after RZ registration is done.
